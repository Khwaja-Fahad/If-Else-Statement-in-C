# If-Else-Statement-in-C
The IfElseExample repository contains a simple C program that demonstrates the use of the if-else statement. The program initializes a variable x with a value of 25 and checks whether it is greater than or equal to 6. If the condition is true, it sets the variable y to 6; otherwise, it assigns the value of x to y. The final value of y is then printed.
